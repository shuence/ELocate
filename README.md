## What We learned

While building this project, We embarked on our  full-stack journey, The journey was both exciting and challenging, and We learned a lot along the way:

1. **Frontend Gracefulness:** As We crafted the frontend, We encountered various errors, but I embraced each challenge as an opportunity to learn. With useState and other hooks, along with Tailwind Css for styling, we built an intuitive and responsive user interface.

2. **Backend Confidence:** Setting up the Express and MongoDB server initially seemed daunting, but We persisted. Working on controllers for API calls and defining routes took time, but We gained confidence as We overcame each obstacle.

3. **Expanded Toolkit:** Throughout the project, We explored additional React concepts like useEffect, useContext, and NextJs 14 SSR Features.

4. **Deployment Know-How:** Deploying the backend server was a crucial step in making the application accessible online. We learned to configure the production environment, manage dependencies, and ensure security with HTTPS and authentication.

5. **Continuous Improvement:** We adopted a proactive approach to monitoring and logging server performance, identifying potential issues early on and implementing CI/CD pipelines for smooth and automated deployments.

6. **The Joy of Problem-Solving:** Despite encountering obstacles, We discovered the joy of problem-solving and the satisfaction that comes with finding solutions to complex challenges.

7. **Version Control and Rollbacks:** We grasped the importance of version control not only for the codebase but also for server configurations, facilitating easy rollbacks if needed.

Overall, this project marked a significant milestone in Our journey in this i-nnovate Hackathon
